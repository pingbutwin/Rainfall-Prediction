This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for binary rainfall prediction using Python and its core data science ecosystem, including Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. The workflow begins with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and rigorous preprocessing, addressing critical challenges such as data imputation, feature correlation analysis, and target variable balancing. After isolating the 12 most significant features based on their predictive power, their distributions were meticulously analyzed and plotted to understand underlying meteorological patterns.
The modeling phase utilized scikit-learn to build a robust testing pipeline, evaluating a variety of algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM (tested with multiple kernels). Through comparative performance metrics, XGBoost was identified as the superior model. To maximize its potential, hyperparameter optimization was performed using Hyperopt combined with Cross-Validation, ultimately achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.89, an accuracy of 81%, and a significant improvement in final model inference time.
